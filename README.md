# Arch-Linux
- dotfiles and scripts

Since I have been using Linux a few months, I have now become afraid that all configs could suddenly dissapear and therefore, it would be nice with at least backup of my most important dotfiles. Furthermore this reposiory will also work as a repository which I can refer to, if I need it on my blog - www.clhansen.dk. 

Since I'm still a noob. Please be gentle if you find errors or general mistakes. Moreover, I'm Danish, so there is bound to be weird sentences and weird spelling. Sorry :)
