# Arch-Linux
- dotfiles and scripts

Since I have been using Linux a few months, I have now become afraid that all configs could suddenly dissapear and therefore, it would be nice with at least backup of my most important dotfiles. 

Since I'm still a noob, please be gentle if you find errors or general mistakes. Moreover, I'm Danish, so there is bound to be weird sentences and weird spelling. Sorry :)
