dotfiles and scripts

Since I have been using Linux a few months and now have become afraid that all could suddenly dissapear, it would be nice with at least backup of my most important dotfiles. Furthermore this reposiory will also work as a repository which I can refer to, if I need it on my blog - www.clhansen.dk. Currently I have only written a few scripts and my dotfiles are most likely quite default. However, it has taken me months to get most of the stuff working, so I guess there is a few things I would miss if it all dissapeared.

Since I'm still a noob. Please be gentle if you find errors or general mistakes. Moreover, I'm Danish, so there is bound to be weird sentences and weird spelling. Sorry :)
